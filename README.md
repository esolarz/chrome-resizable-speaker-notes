# Resizable Speaker Notes for Google Slides #

When presenting in Google Slides with speaker notes, the slide previews are extremely small and nearly unusable. This Google Chrome extension allows you to drag and resize the sidebar to enlarge the previews. You can adjust the previews of the current/previous/next slides so that they are large enough that you don't have to keep turning around to see the projected screen; you can keep your eyes towards the audience.
